					In the year 29XX, peace has been restored to the humans and reploids on Earth. Since 200X, robots and humans have always had conflict, but now, a new era has been born. No longer will the evil forces of Dr. Wily, the Mavericks, Neo Arcadia, or Model W plague civilization; they have been defeated by the great Mega Men of time past. Through the brave efforts of heroes such as Megaman, X, Zero, and Vent, all has returned to normal, and both humans and reploids are happy.
				</p>
				<p>
					One day, a brilliant scientist discovered the age old records of the heroes of the past. Using advanced technology, Dr. Lite was able to recreate all the old heroes, copying their parts and memory chips. The world looked on with excitement as the Mega Men were reborn.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<img src = "images/story.png" class = "float-left" width = "300px" height = "247px" alt = "The Mega Men Reborn">
					Yet, the Dr. Lite's discovery was not without consequence. A group of Russian scientists known as the Cossacks stole the Mega Man records from Dr. Lite's Lab and created "enhanced" versions of the heroes of old. However, these new Mega Men became corrupted of their power and had little regard for what the world called "peace." One day, the Cossack lab exploded and these Mega Men stepped out into the world. They used their incredible power to take the planet by storm, but they bickered over who would rule their new dominion. They decided to hold a tournament in which they fought each other to see who was the strongest and most fit to rule.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Lite, horrified at what he had done, decided to use his own Mega Men to defeat the Cossack versions. He had his Mega Men join the tournament, hoping that they would destroy the Cossack Mega Men. Yet, it was impossible to differentiate between Lite and the Cossack Mega Men because they were based on the same data. Lite's Mega Men had no choice but to defeat all Mega Men, friend or foe, striving to make it to the top to ensure the retirement of all Mega Men.
				</p>
				<p >
					Who shall prevail in this tournament? Will the forces of good once again defeat evil? Or will Earth's "everlasting" peace come to an abrupt end? Only you can decide!

				</p>
				<h2> Controls </h2>

				</p>
				<h2> Gameplay </h2>
				<p>
					Play begins when both players warp on screen. Player 1 will generally be on the left, and Player 2 on the right. Player 1's health bar is on the left, and Player 2's is on the right. Your objective to defeat your opponent using the moves at your disposal by draining their health bar to zero.
				</p>
				<p>Additional Notes:</p>
				<ul>

					<li>After you are through the stun period, you will be invincible for a short period of time. Enemy attacks will not harm you, so use this time to recover. You can still die by falling off the stage, however.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2> Installing Stages </h2>
